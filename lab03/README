* LAB 03: make, diff

NOTE: Lab READMEs will differ from assignment READMEs from this point forward 
      because the course would prefer that students focus more on completing
      the lab rather than worrying about the README; thus, lab READMEs will be
      shorter and will only ask for the student's name, collaborators, and 
      feedback on the lab. :)

COLLABORATORS:
---------------

    TODO: I collaborated with some students that were in lab with me.

FEEDBACK/NOTES:
----------------
    TODO: Let us know if you have any feedback for this lab!
    
    It seemed like the lab slides had slightly different conventions for 
    Makefile syntax compared to the spec and comments in starter code.
