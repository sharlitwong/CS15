PROGRAM PURPOSE:
---------------
    This lab assignment offers CS 15 students with hands on practice with
    linked lists.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
----------------
    I read about Linked Lists on: 
    https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/linked-lists/
    to refresh my memory from Comp 11. I also got help from my lab TA Lawrence
    when the order of my planets were not being printed correctly. I also
    discussed some initial ideas with other students in my lab.
    *REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR OWN ACKNOWLEDGMENTS*

FILES:
-----

   planet-driver.cpp: Main driver for the linked list of planets.
                      Reads in planets from cin, before adding them to two 
                      lists. Also has space for a JFFE that reverses the first
                      list. 
          ** STUDENT TODO: Insert planets to two lists - one by pushAtFront, the
          other by pushAtBack. Then, implement the destructor. 

    LinkedList.cpp: Implementation of the LinkedList class which includes key
                    functions regarding the linked list, such as the default 
                    constructor, print function, destructor, and other helper 
                    functions.
          ** STUDENT TODO: Write pushAtFront, pushAtBack, and the destructor.

    LinkedList.h: Interface of LinkedList class, which includes key information
                  regarding the LinkedList class.

    Planet.cpp: Implementation of Planet class which includes a default and
                parametrized constructor which creates Planet objects, a print
                function, and assignment operator.

    Planet.h: Interface of Planet class, which includes key information
              regarding Planet objects.


HOW TO COMPILE/LINK/RUN:
-----------------------
    * Compile with "make planet-driver"
    * Run with "./planet-driver"

DATA STRUCTURES:
---------------

    The main data structure of this lab is a singly linked list. Inserting at
    the front of a linked list is O(1). Inserting at the back is
    O(list_length) (or O(1) if there is a back pointer). Access is O(n) because
    the worst case run time is if the element that is being looked for is the 
    last element in the list. A linked list is useful because it can be used
    dynamically and it is relatively easy to insert and delete nodes. A 
    disadvantage of linked lists is that it is difficult to access elements
    quickly, as you cannot directly access elements like with an array and must
    traverse the list to access elements.
    ** This section of your README should be quite thorough for homeworks!

TESTING:
-------
    ** REPLACE WITH YOUR TESTING STRATEGIES. **
    You can describe: process of testing (unit tests), bugs you encountered,
    testing inputs (different sizes and edge cases), base cases you considered
    while testing. Demonstrate a methodical approach to testing. This section
    of your README should be quite thorough for homework assignments!

QUESTIONS:
-------
    1. What is Valgrind?

    A debugging tool for detecting memory leaks, segfaults or other errors. 

    2. How do you run Valgrind?

    It will automatically run with unit_tests. Using the keyword "valgrind" 
    before running some executable (ex: valgrind ./planet-driver) would also run
    valgrind.

    3. Why is Valgrind useful? What kinds of errors can Valgrind tell you about?

    Memory leakage errors from the heap. 


NOTE: As stated earlier, this lab comes partially implemented. The Planet class
      is already written and the much of the Linked List class is also written. 
      The driver also already is mostly implemented, but students must write 
      and utilize two insertion functions, as well as the destructor.
