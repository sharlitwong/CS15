 * unit_tests.h
 * Matt Russell && Matt Champlin
 * 1/6/2021
 * This file demonstrates test style for the unit_test unit testing framework.
 *
 * Rules for unit tests:
 *     Test file name must be unit_tests.h
 *     All test functions must take no arguments
 *     All test functions must return void
 *
 * Background info for tests:
 *     If a test finishes execution, it is considered successful.
 *     Use assert(boolean_expression) to test for known conditions.
 *     If the expression evaluates to false, then the assertion fails.
 *     Tests will also fail on segfaults, etc.
 *
 * Other notes:
 *     Be sure to #include any .h files as necessary
 *     Each test must have a unique name
 *     Valgrind will be run automatically on all tests
 *
 * Workflow encouragements:
 *     You are encouraged to write MANY, MANY tests!!!
 *     Furthermore, you are encouraged to write and run tests as you work.
 *     So, the workflow should be something along the lines of:
 *            1) Write a function (or part of a function)
 *            2) Write at least 1 test for the code you just wrote
 *            3) Run the tests, and fix all errors (including memory issues)
 *            4) Rinse and Repeat!
 *    *** It is wise to debug BEFORE moving on to writing the next function. ***
 *
 * NB: The ArrayList code has bugs, so (some) tests will fail first on purpose!
 * Be sure to ask questions!!
