NOTE: Below is an example of a README that you can use for your future labs and
assignments. Steal this format! It will save you points later. Read through the
file and fill in the TODO's.

Program Purpose:
---------------

    TODO: Add in the purpose of this program. Remember that a programs purpose
    is what the program does! Not the details of the implementation. What do
    the files you write do in this lab?

    Basic implementation of Arraylist class.

Compile/run:
-----------

    Compile and Run using the command "unit_test"


Acknowledgments:
---------------

    TODO: Add any Acknowledgments here. Perhaps one of your lovely TA's? Or a
    fellow student?

Files:
-----

ArrayList.h: Interface for a simple ArrayList Class.

ArrayList.cpp: Implementation of a simple ArrayList Class.
    The default constructor for this class initializes an ArrayList to a size of
    0, and a capacity of 10. 

unit_tests.h: A unit testing file for the ArrayList Class. 
    Runs in conjunction with the unit_test framework to allow for testing of 
    individual functions.

Makefile: File to build the program.


Data Structures:
---------------

    This main data structure of this lab is an ArrayList, which is a dynamically
    expanding array. If the number of items is ever equal to the capacity, the
    array will automatically expand, allowing for an arbitrary number of 
    elements to be inserted into the ArrayList.


Testing:
-------

    TODO: Write a short description of how you tested your ArrayList. What was
    the most challenging part of this lab?
