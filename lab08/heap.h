/* CS15 Lab: Heaps
 *
 * A class that organizes a collection of strings into a min-heap.
 * 
 * Heap Time Complexity with below implementation:
 *      O(n log n) construction (can be O(n) if you use algorithm from class)!
 *      O(log n)   insertion
 *      O(1)       to access minimum element
 *      O(log n)   to remove minimum element.
