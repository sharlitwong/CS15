NOTE: Lab READMEs will differ from assignment READMEs because the course would 
      prefer that students focus more on completing the lab rather than 
      worrying about the README; thus, lab READMEs will be shorter and will 
      only ask for the student's name, collaborators, and feedback on the lab. 
      :)
