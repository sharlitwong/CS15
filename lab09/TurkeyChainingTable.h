/*
 * CS15 Lab 10: Hash Tables
 * 
 * TurkeyChainingTable.h
 * This hash table maps dish names (strings) to information about
 * that dish: the serving size and preparation time in minutes.
 *
 * For the hash table, the dish name (strings) are keys and the
 * values are structs containing the serving size and preparation time.
 *
 * In a proper polymorphic (templated) hash table, this struct would 
 * be the value type and would be defined by the client independently
 * of the table. The key type would be string.
 * 
 * Based on a previous hash table lab I think created by Ben Hescott.
