Answer the questions below, and submit your answers under the assignment
"MetroSim Design Checkoff" on Gradescope. You must sign up for a design
checkoff slot with a TA to discuss your provided answers (see spec for link).

Unless otherwise specified, your answers below should be *brief*: no more
than three sentences/question.

1. Are you comfortable with reading from stdin (user input) and a text file 
in C++? Are you comfortable reading different types (e.g. ints and strings)?
For this one, don't just answer 'yes' if you are. Write out which data 
types you will need and which functions you will call. 

Answer:

Somewhat - I remember file I/O from CS11 but will need to review, especially 
outputting to different files and handling multiple input sources.
I will need to read string (for station names and commands) and int (for station
numbers in passenger commands). I'll use std::ifstream for reading files, 
std::ofstream for writing to the output file, std::getline() for reading full 
lines with spaces, the >> operator for tokens, and std::cin for user input when 
no command file is provided.

2. What happens when I move the train (with 'm m') when the train is at the
last provided station? 

Answer: The train's next station should be the first provided station; the 
train should wrap back around. 

3. What classes will you need in your program? What interfaces (i.e. 
functions) do they each provide? 

Answer: 

Classes I will need that are required by the spec (and their functions):
1. Passenger class (just functions mentioned in spec)
2. PassengerQueue class (just functions mentioned in spec)
3. MetroSim class (will handle initialization from files, process commands, 
manage the simulation state with a vector of stations, vector of PassengerQueues
for the train, and an integer index for current station location)

Classes I will need that aren't required by the spec:
1. Stations class (has a string name, and a passenger queue of passengers 
waiting to be picked up)

4. How will you implement add a passenger to a station? How will this 
impact the data structure(s) you use to represent the stations in the 
simulation? 

Answer: My station class will hold a passengerqueue member, which would be 
private. However, I'd have functions to kind of wrap the dequeue and enqueue 
functions from passengerqueue but for station. Station would also have functions
to get the name and set the name. 

5. How will you implement moving a train from one station into the next? 
How will you put passengers onto the train? How will you take off the
correct passengers who are leaving at the next station? How will these 
considerations impact the data structure(s) you use to represent the 
train in the simulation? 

Answer: 

I would have some index (in metrosim class) that keeps track of which station 
the train is currently at, the index would only increment after the command 
"m m".

I would have a function in my stations class called pickUp (or something like 
that), which would take in the index of where the train is currently at. Within 
the pickUp function, I'd iterate through the waiting passengers, and and add 
them to the passengerqueue in the train that corresponds to their destination 
station (via the enqueue function from passengerqueue).

After every "m m" command, every passenger on the passenger queue that 
corresponds to arriving at the current station will be dequeued. 

So each call of m m triggers: passengers at station (that we're about to move 
away from) get on, current station index increments, then passengers get off the
train (at the new station we've just arrived at).


6. Does command behavior change based on the source of commands? 
Based on your answer, how could we modularize our command processing
code? Be as detailed as you can.

Answer:
Command behavior does not change based on the source --the same commands ('p', 
'm m', 'm f') work identically whether from a file or stdin. To modularize, I'll
create a command processing function that takes an std::istream& reference as a 
parameter. Then I can pass either an std::ifstream (for file input) or std::cin 
(for user input) to this function, allowing the same code to handle both cases 
without duplication.

7. How do you plan to test your program? What evidence of testing do
you plan to submit? 

Answer: 

For Phase 1, I'll write unit tests in unit_tests.h to test Passenger and 
PassengerQueue functions (enqueue, dequeue, front, size, print) and edge cases 
like empty queues. For the full MetroSim, I'll create custom command and station
files to test different scenarios (train wrapping, multiple passengers, 
boarding/exiting) and use the diff command to compare my output with 
the_MetroSim. I'll submit my unit_tests.h and any custom test input files I 
create.

I'll also attend the shell scripting tutorial, and hopefully that'll help make 
testing easier.

8. What is your timeline for completing this project? What would you like 
to have completed, and by which dates?   

Answer: 

Days 1-2: Complete design checkoff and review file I/O. Days 3-4: Implement and 
test Passenger and PassengerQueue for Phase 1 (due end of week 1). Days 5-7: 
Implement Station and MetroSim classes with train movement logic. Days 8-9: Add 
command processing and file I/O handling. Days 10-12: testing with diff, 
debugging, and README writing. Day 13: Final submission.
